# polynomial

This is an example, how a shared library, being written, compiled and linked with unknown tools but fullfilling the rules for shared libraries of the given system, can be used. The folder deploy contains everything, that is necessary to use the library polynomial and an usage example. I started with using it with Free Pascal Compiler. If somebody knows, how to use the library in other tools, guids and examples are welcome.
